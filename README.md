Adds a "popular" badge to discussions based on custom criteria.

The available criteria are:

- Number of comments
- Number of views (works with either `michaelbelgium/flarum-discussion-views` or `flarumite/simple-discussion-views`)

The computation of the badge is done client-side based on the information the current user can see.
